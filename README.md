# Psychonomics 2022 - Metamemory I (232)

## Exploring the Mechanisms of Output Interference During Cued Recall Using Metamemory Judgments

The files in this repo support the spoken presentation for the Psychonomic Society. For Quarto files that are in a subdirectory, they are called by the main script. R files prepended by an underscore (`_`) are called by the main R script.

Unfortunately, I am not able to upload raw data files to Github/OSF. Please contact TC if you have any questions or concerns.
