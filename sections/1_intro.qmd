# OVERVIEW

## Memory Interference

- Long-term memory retrieval is often affected by competing information.
  + Commonly called **memory interference**.

- Most interference effects show increases in errors in which people recall the wrong item.
  + i.e., errors of **commission**.
  + e.g., proactive interference (Postman et al., 1968), implicit interference (Nelson et al., 1998). 

- The implication is that memory interference states stem from similar operations; however, some interference states are different than others.
  + **Output interference (OI)**.

## Output Interference

Errors of **omission** increase while errors of **commission** stay the same (Wilson et al., 2020).

## Mechanisms of OI

- Most accounts of interference implicate the roles of _spreading activation_ and _competition_.
  + _citations_

- OI, however, seems to result from the act of retrieval itself (Anderson & Neely, 1996).

- For example, Wilson et al. (2020) hypothesize the presence of a **retrieval filter** that limits the number of retrieval attempts.
  + Retrieval of items later in the recall sequence inhibited by repeated retrieval of earlier items.
  + Repeated retrievals cause memory to reach maximum number of retrieval attempts before the target item or non-criterial information related to it can be accessed.
  + Similar to $T_{Max}$ parameter in Minerva/HyGene frameworks.

- What is unknown is whether OI is a function of interference via spreading activation (i.e., a "Competition" account) or lack of access to criterial information altogheter (i.e., a "Suppression" account).

## Memory Awareness

- Metamemory judgments are sensitive to interference states, but to different degrees.
  + e.g., Eakin (2005), Diaz & Benjamin (2008)

- Eakin & Hertzog (2012) found, for example, that prospective memory judgments for irretrievable items, known as **_feelings-of-knowing_ (FOKs)**, changed in magnitude, but not in accuracy, during implicit interference.
  + 

- Sensitivity of metamemory judgments to interference states can help elucidate underlying mechanisms.

## Current Study

The current study used self-reported metamemory judgments to examine the mechanism underlying output interference during cued recall.

I use feelings-of-knowing (FOKs) and Remember/Know/No Memory (R/K/N) judgments to contrast two hypotheses:

- **Competition Hypothesis**
  + Increases in "Know" judgements during OI, reflecting familiarity states during semantic competition.
  + Inhibition of target recall, but not of non-criterial information, during OI; similar FOK accuracy across trials.

- **Retrieval-suppression Hypothesis**
  + Increases in rates of "No Memory" judgments during OI; no changes in "R" or "K".
  + Occlusion of non-criterial recollection during OI, resulting in decreases in FOK accuracy across trials
