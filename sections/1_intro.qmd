# OVERVIEW

## Memory Interference

- Long-term memory retrieval is often affected by competing information
  + Commonly called **memory interference**
  + _citations here_

- Most interference effects show increases in errors in which people recall the wrong item 
  + i.e., errors of **commission**
  + e.g., proactive interference (_citation_), implicit interference (_citation_) 

- The implication is that memory interference states stem from similar operations; however, some interference states are different than others
  + **Output interference (OI)**

Errors of **omission** increase while errors of **commission** stay the same.
