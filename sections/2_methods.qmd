- Sample consisted of 85 college-aged students recruited from Georgia Tech's research subject pool.
- Random (blind) assignment to 2 between-subjects conditions:
  + **_Related Cues_**
  + **_Unrelated Cues_**

## Conditions

- Individuals in the **Unrelated Cues** condition studied lists of 40 _unrelated_ cue-target word pairs.
- Individuals in the **Related Cues** condition studied 4 lists of 10 cue-target word pairs where the cue words were _categorically-related_, but unrelated to the target words. 
  + Cue words were selected from 10 exemplars from 4 normative taxonomic categories (Van Overschelde et al., 2004).
  + The target words were unrelated to each other.

Example stimuli:

| **Unrelated** | **Related** |
|:---------:|:-------:|
| NEEDLE - QUESTION | RAIN	- MIRAGE |
| OUTSIDE -	LOST | SLEET -	EAST |
| POST - FROWN | SNOW -	PRECISE |
| PULL - CRISP | LIGHTNING -	CIRCLE |

## Procedure

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

* **Study**
  + 40 cue-target word pairs x 2.
  + Presented in random order.
* **Cued Recall**
  + Cued recall attempt + R/K/N + FOK (0-100)
  + _Related Cues_: 4 blocks of 10 trials where cue words are from same category.
  + _Unrelated Cues_: 40 trials in random order.
* **Recognition**
  + 4AFC attempt + RCJ (0-100)
  + 40 trials in random order.

- We presented the cue-target pairs twice (in 2 blocks) to bring recall accuracy off of floor.
